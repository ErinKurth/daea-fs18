		 <p>Amenhotep III, son of Tuthmosis IV, was the ninth king of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. He was known as the Pharaoh who brought “prosperity and peace.” He bought upon political stability and devoted his time to the arts in Egypt. Under his reign, he’s constructed many of the most phenomenal structures of ancient Egypt and with help of his military, he was able to extend and strengthen their borders. He completely transformed the landscape of the Nile River. When Amenhotep III was twelve years old, he married Tiye and came to the throne. Once Amenhotep III was older and able to make decisions, he really succeeded in having high approval ratings. He was coined the term “Master of Diplomacy,” due to his “debt through lavish gifts of gold so that they would be inclined to bend to his wishes…” According to researchers, Amenhotep III was considered probably the richest man in the world. During the imperial age, gold flowed into Egypt more than out. Foreign rulers look towards Amenhotep III for gold. They pleaded for it to help change the landscape in their own country.</p>

     <p>In 1353 BCE, Pharaoh Amenhotep III died from health complications. His ruling lasted about 40 years alongside his wife, Queen Tiye. He established many great relations with nations around. It was said that they wrote letters once he passed away stating that they will continue to bond with Egypt even though Amenhotep III is gone. His son, Amenhotep IV, succeeded his father and continued follow his father’s steps until he made some changes during his fifth year. Egypt fell under the reign of Amenhotep IV. After his passing, Horemheb took over and tried his best to restore Egypt to the days when Amenhotep III ruled, however it didn’t manage to reach those heights again. Amenhotep III went down to be the “luxurious pharaoh, diplomat, hunter, warrior, and great architect of Egyptian monuments.</p>

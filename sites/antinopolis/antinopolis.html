<p>The city of Antinopolis was founded by the Roman emperor Hadrian to honor the memory of Antinous, his former lover, who drowned in the Nile during 130CE. Antinopolis was the site of the cult of Antinous, whom Hadrian deified after his death, and who was likened to Osiris due to his manner of death. Architecturally, Antinopolis was constructed in the Greco-Roman style and contrasted sharply with the Egyptian architecture of surrounding cities. The city had its own Senate and Prytaneus (President), and became the capital of the nome of Thebaid under the reign of Diocletian. In the 4th century CE, Antinopolois became the seat of a Christian bishop, and is now listed by the Catholic Church as being a titular see. Antinopolis was abandoned at some point during the 10th century for unknown reasons, and today very little remains of this ancient city. Many of the older structures were removed to make room for sugar factories, however several temple ruins can still be found here, as well as some remains of a Roman Circus that once existed there.</p>

<h3>Geography of Site</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>The Roman city of Antinoopolis was built on the ruins of an abandoned New Kingdom Egyptian site, located slightly south of the city of Besa. The city was established on a necropolis and the site of a temple of Ramses the II. As a center of trade, Antinoopolis was connected by the Via Hadriana--an ancient Roman road--to Berenice Troglodytica, an Egyptian port located on the Red Sea (Encyclopedia Britannica). This connection allowed for trade with India and China, and proved advantageous for the ancient city. Located in middle Egypt on the east bank of the Nile River, Antinoopolis, as well as its neighboring city of Hermopolis, was a part of a 15km-wide floodplain. (Bunbury, J.; Malouta, M., 2012) There is evidence that the Nile was slowly migrating towards the city of Antinoopolis at a rate of approximately 2.2 km/millenium until 130 CE and then stopped, which “is suggestive of an anchoring of the river by the Roman town by a mixture of revetment of the banks and reduction in the erosive power of the Nile by removal of water for irrigation.” (Bunbury, J.; Malouta, M., 2012) During a visit to the ancient city in 1798, French scientist Edme Francois Jomard describes Antinoopolis as having walls on three sides, with the exception being the side that faced the Nile River itself. (Lane, E.W., 1809) Other sources also describe the city as being “walled round.” (Richardson, R., 1822) Pertaining to the structure of the city itself, there is evidence of there having been two main streets, perpendicular to one another, each lined with columns and terminating in gates. (Richardson, R., 1822) The city had a trapezoidal shape and a grid-like plan, with streets being divided into quarters and blocks. On the east side of the city was a natural valley (also known as a wadi) that bordered a desert landscape.</p>

<p>In “Travels Along the Mediterranean and Parts Adjacent,” Richardson describes Antinoopolis in the early 1800s, when what remained of the city was already in ruins. He writes of “broad and spacious [streets], with a row of columns on each side for for bazaars, or a shady lounge.” (pg. 166) He describes columns of granite and coarse-shell limestone, as well as a “triumphal arc of the corinthian order, which the inhabitants were pulling down by order of the governor.” (pg. 166) Some of the columns are said to have had inscriptions that conveyed that they were constructed when Epimevius Honorious was governor, and reference an event involving Septimius Severus. In 1715, Jesuit missionary Claude Sicard journeyed throughout Egypt and wrote the following about Antinoopolis: “[Antinoopolis] presents first to the eye some public buildings of royal magnificence...One can say that this City was one continuous peristyle; from which we can judge that the Emperor Hadrian had as much regard to the convenience of the citizens, as to the magnificence of a monument that he wanted to leave to posterity.” (Sicard, C., 1717) Sicard describes galleries, vaults, and the four city gates, a magnificent portico, and many piles of stones and columns containing “all kinds of marble.” “La Description de l’Egypte,” a product of a French expedition under Napoleon, contains detailed descriptions of various Egyptian sites including Antinoopolis, as well as sketches of various buildings and column details which can give an enhanced view of what the ancient city would have looked closer to in its ancient splendor.</p>

<h3>Excavations</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>To get a sense of the structures, monuments, and overall construction of ancient Antinoopolis, we must look to not just the travel accounts of missionaries and scientists, but also to the archaeological evidence uncovered by anthropologists over the last century. While detailed accounts of the city began to emerge much earlier in history (such as the aforementioned accounts by Jomard, Sicard, and Richardson), archaeological excavations of Antinoopolis did not officially begin until Alfred Jean Gayet’s 1896-1912 excavation. Before this, during the Napolenaic Expedition of 1798 (led by Jormand), large structures such as the city’s theater, triumphal arc, tetrasyla, temples, an hippodrome were recorded. During Gayet’s excavations, however, he went deeper, looking at mortuary remains, excavating several cemetaries and discovering funerary portraits such as the Tondo of Two Brothers (in which tondo refers to a circular painting/relief). Gayet helped to discover many mummy portraits created on wood and linen. One of Gayet’s most important contributions to our modern understanding of Antinoopolis can comes from his 1897 paper, “L'Exploration des Ruines d'Antinoë et la Découverte d'un Temple de Ramsès II enclos dans l'Enceinte de la Ville d'Hadrien,” which translates to “The Exploration of the Antinoë Ruins and the Discovery of a Temple of Ramses II Enclosed in the Enclosure of the City of Hadrian.” (Gayet, A., 1897) In this paper, Gayet describes how he and his team discovered the existence of the temple of Ramses II as well as several previously unknown cemeteries and tombs outside of the main city (Bell, H.I., 1940).</p>

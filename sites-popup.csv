<h3>Gebel el Haridi</h3>,<h4>Coptic Period</h4>,26.555983,31.700389,"The preliminary surveys of Gebel el-Haridi revealed significant archaeological material from the Old Kingdom to the Coptic period. The archaeological remains that were discovered illustrate several types of continued occupation at the site. A large stone quarry, rock-cut tombs used as necropolis and an enclosed mud-brick settlement were all found within the boundaries. George Wilkinson, Robert Hay, Nestor L'Hote and Bonomi traveled the Gebel el-Haridi region during the nineteenth century. These men recorded what they saw as they travelled through the region, such as Ptolemaic quarries, Christian brick ruins, tombs, and mutilated statues.",<a href='sites/gebel-el-haridi/gebel-el-haridi.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
<h3>KV20</h3>,<h4>18th Dynasty</h4>,25.73333056,32.59999722,"KV20 was one of the very first tombs to be built in the Valley of the Kings.  Constructed during the Eighteenth Dynasty, KV20 was originally Thutmose Iâ€™s burial place before he was moved to a different tomb.  The famous pharaoh Hatshepsut was interred there after she died.  Originally known to Napoleonic Exploration in 1799, KV20 was excavated by Howard Carter between 1903 and 1904.  The site is located on the easternmost part of the Valley of the Kings, and varies from other tombs in the Valley due to its layout and the clockwise corridors, which are considered to be atypical for tombs of that time.  KV20 had been looted, and Hatshepsut's mummy had disappeared, though there was a mummified organ with her cartouche that was found inside the tomb.",<a href='sites/kv20/kv20'>MORE DETAILS</a>

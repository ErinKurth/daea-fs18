<h3>Gebel el Haridi</h3>,<h4>Coptic Period</h4>,26.555983,31.700389,"The preliminary surveys of Gebel el-Haridi revealed significant archaeological material from the Old Kingdom to the Coptic period. The archaeological remains that were discovered illustrate several types of continued occupation at the site. A large stone quarry, rock-cut tombs used as necropolis and an enclosed mud-brick settlement were all found within the boundaries. George Wilkinson, Robert Hay, Nestor L'Hote and Bonomi traveled the Gebel el-Haridi region during the nineteenth century. These men recorded what they saw as they travelled through the region, such as Ptolemaic quarries, Christian brick ruins, tombs, and mutilated statues.",<a href='sites/gebel-el-haridi/gebel-el-haridi.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
<h3>KV20</h3>,<h4>18th Dynasty</h4>,25.73333056,32.59999722,"KV20 was one of the very first tombs to be built in the Valley of the Kings.  Constructed during the Eighteenth Dynasty, KV20 was originally Thutmose I's burial place before he was moved to a different tomb.  The famous pharaoh Hatshepsut was interred there after she died.  Originally known to Napoleonic Exploration in 1799, KV20 was excavated by Howard Carter between 1903 and 1904.  The site is located on the easternmost part of the Valley of the Kings, and varies from other tombs in the Valley due to its layout and the clockwise corridors, which are considered to be atypical for tombs of that time.  KV20 had been looted, and Hatshepsut's mummy had disappeared, though there was a mummified organ with her cartouche that was found inside the tomb.",<a href='sites/kv20/kv20.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

<h3>Kom Abu Bello</h3>,<h4>11th Century to 8th Century BC</h4>,30.259817,30.489957,"Kom Abu Bello, an ancient Egyptian site, also known as Mefket in ancient Egyptian Pharaonic times. Although there a very little remains including artifacts and tombs, and that a major part of this ancient city is now covered by the modern town of Tarana, Kom Abu Bello has played a significant role in the reconstruction of historical culture, religion, and social relations in ancient Egypt from circa 300 BC to AD 500. Especially during the period of conversion from the Pharaonic era into the Coptic era, where this site was also known as Terenuthis during the Graeco-Roman period, and later known as Terenouti during the Coptic era.",<a href='sites/kom-abu-bello/kom-abu-bello.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

It is located on the West Bank of the Nile in Deir el-Bahr directly next to the Mortuary Temple of Mentuhotep, which is considered the inspiration for the building. However Hatshepsut wanted to make hers much larger and more grand than Mentuhoteps in order to help legitimize her rule.  The structure itself has three levels with various hieroglyphs and paintings, as well as statues.  Though much of the temple was destroyed or altered by Hatshepsuts stepson Thutmose III it is still a very well preserved example of Egyptian architecture.",<a href='sites/mortuary-temple-hatshepsut/mortuary-temple-hatshepsut.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
<h3>Antinopolis</h3>,<h4>Roman Period</h4>,27.816667,30.883333,"The city of Antinopolis was founded by the Roman emperor Hadrian to honor the memory of Antinous, his former lover, who drowned in the Nile during AD 130. Antinopolis was the site of the cult of Antinous, whom Hadrian deified after his death, and who was likened to Osiris due to his manner of death. Architecturally, Antinopolis was constructed in the Greco-Roman style, and contrasted sharply with the Egyptian architecture of surrounding cities. The city had its own Senate and Prytaneus (President), and became the capital of the nome of Thebaid under the reign of Diocletian. In the 4th century AD, Antinopolois became the seat of a Christian bishop, and is now listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. Antinopolis was abandoned at some point in the 10th century for unknown reasons, and today very little remains of this ancient city. Many of the older structures were removed to make room for sugar factories, however several temple ruins can still be found here, as well as some remains of a Roman Circus that once existed there.",<a href='sites/antinopolis/antinopolis.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
